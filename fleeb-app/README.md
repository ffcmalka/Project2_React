# Getting Started with Character Gun Portal

### Link to API: https://rickandmortyapi.com/

## Goals
My goal is to create either index cards or a search engine where you can search up or find more information about a character in the show. 
It should be able to render whether the character is alive or not, which episode they're from, and their last known location

## Stretch Goals
If I am able to I want to incorporate a search engine so people can find their favorite character and see the info.

## MVP

### Create at least index cards with info on them.
